This is a trial of a code editor based on codepen.

Use it as much as you want, let me know if there is anything you want added.

Typing ! (exclamation mark) will get you a basic HTML layout.

eg.
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang='en'>
<head>
    <meta charset='UTF-8'>
    <meta name='viewport' content='width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0'>
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>
